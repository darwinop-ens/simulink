Matlab Simulink Library for the darwinop-ens robot

Development version

Stable releases can be viewed and downloaded from the following links:
v1.0 https://github.com/darwinop-ens/simulink/tree/v1.0

This directory and its subdirectories contain Matlab code and Simulink libraries to communicate with the DarwinOP humanoid robot.

About this library:

At this time, the "Software In Loop (SIL)" and "Hardware In Loop (HIL)" modes are supported:
- During simulation, Matlab Simulink communicates with the robot using a custom instrumentation protocol with embedded program /darwin/Linux/project/instrumentation/instrumentation from the darwinop-op repository located at https://github.com/darwinop-ens/darwin-op
- During execution, Matlab generates a C++ program based on the Simulink model, this program is automatically sent, compiled and executed on the robot.

Installation steps:

1. Open Matlab
2. Download zip file https://github.com/darwinop-ens/darwin-op/archive/master.zip
3. Extract this archive to your local hard disk
4. Execute script darwinoplib_setup.m

You should get "DarwinOP Target Path Setup Complete.", then you can select your language (English or French as of now).

5. Restart Matlab

You should now have a Simulink library named "DarwinOP Lib", demos are located in darwinoplibdemos
